# tlusty-kurucz-launcher

As core of Protmag project, we need to have both scientifically approven models of stellar atmospheres - Kurucz and Tlusty, unified into one launchable application, also producing synthetic spectrum using Synspec as part of it.

So far project is part of intra-company incubator, slowly going public.
